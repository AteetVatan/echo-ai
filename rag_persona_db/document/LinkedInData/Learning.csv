Hebrew for Absolute Beginners,"<p>Brand new to Hebrew? This course is a simple but comprehensive audio course designed to be the easiest way to start learning and speaking Hebrew. Learning Hebrew can be easy or hard, and it all depends on HOW you start. Start the hard way (reading grammar and memorizing words), and you’ll quickly think, “Languages are just not my thing.” Start easy, and you’ll be shocked by how much Hebrew you’ll learn. Listen to real native speakers to get accustomed to the flow of Hebrew. Hear everyday conversations to learn practical dialogue. And start speaking from your first lesson. This course also includes a PDF that covers everything from the audio tracks and much more.</p>

Build with AI: Create Agents with the OpenAI Agents SDK,"In this hands-on course, you’ll create an AI-powered travel agent using Python and the OpenAI Agents SDK. You’ll learn how to build an intelligent assistant that plans trips, recommends destinations, and adapts to user preferences. Along the way, you’ll explore how to extend your agent with tools that search the web for real-world travel data and delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents. You’ll also add guardrails, sessions, and tracing to make your agents safe, reliable, and easy to debug. By the end, you’ll have a working multi-agent travel assistant and the practical skills to build your own intelligent systems with the OpenAI Agents SDK.",Course,2025-11-23 13:57 UTC,N/A,false,N/A,
LLM Foundations: Vector Databases for Caching and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),"<p>As large language models grow in popularity, the infrastructure to be used around them also becomes vital to reduce costs, generate accurate responses, and improve efficiency. Vector databases play a vital role in several LLM use cases to help alleviate LLM shortcomings, reduce costs and latency. Knowledge of its basics and applications are vital for any engineer building applications with LLMs, and in this course, Kumaran Ponnambalam teaches you the basics of vector databases and how to use them in LLM caching and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
 </p>
Kumaran begins with a discussion on the basics of vector databases and their applications. He then explores specialized databases for storing vectors and uses the Milvus database as the reference example, and demonstrates read and write operations with the Milvus database. Learn how to use vector databases for LLM caching, with an example use case, along with examples of RAG use cases. Finally, Kumaran concludes with a discussion on optimizing vector databases.",Course,2025-12-01 03:54 UTC,N/A,false,N/A,
