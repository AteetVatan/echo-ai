With a strong foundation in backend engineering (14+ years) and a focused transition into LLM-based solution engineering since December 2024, I bring applied, hands-on experience in building and deploying generative AI systems designed for real-world impact.  I specialize in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector search, and LLM orchestration using frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen. My flagship project, MASX AI, is a fully deployed multi-agent geopolitical forecasting system powered by GPT-4, Mistral, and vector pipelines using FAISS and Redis. I’ve integrated OpenAI, Groq, and Hugging Face models into backend services built with FastAPI and deployed using Docker, Airflow, and GitHub Actions.  In recent projects, I have:  Built production-ready RAG apps integrated with REST APIs and scalable data pipelines Customized prompt logic for GPT and open-source models, optimizing for latency and cost Collaborated with data teams on preprocessing and compliance in live ETL workflows Deployed solutions with CI/CD automation across cloud environments including AWS and Azure  I’m passionate about applied generative AI, especially where it solves business challenges. I work fast, document clearly, and partner well with product and engineering teams.  Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your applied AI initiatives.

With 14+ years of experience in full-stack software development and a focused transition into AI Engineering since December 2024, I bring a unique combination of mature engineering practices and cutting-edge AI workflow expertise.  Since transitioning into the AI space, I’ve created MASX AI, a multi-agent orchestration platform built with LangChain and AutoGen. It simulates real-time geopolitical reasoning using vector retrieval (RAG), async ingestion pipelines, and LLM orchestration (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Mistral). I’ve personally designed agent routing logic, tool-based memory chains, and CI/CD deployments using Docker, Redis, and Airflow.  Your freelance role aligns perfectly with my current focus. I’ve written production-grade Python scripts for data ingestion, prompt formatting, and model benchmarking; handled large datasets using Supabase and ChromaDB; and optimized output structures in Markdown, JSON, and table formats. My hands-on experience troubleshooting LLM pipeline issues and building cost-aware inference systems makes me confident I can contribute meaningfully to your AI projects.  I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with Mindrift and help shape AI systems that are not only powerful but also grounded in real-world intelligence and structure.  Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing to your mission.

End to end system ownership at 12IQ, I led the architecture and full build-out of a large-scale deterministic AI platform. That included designing the orchestration backbone, context and knowledge layers, and multi-model validation along with standardizing reusable patterns like tool/function calling, structured outputs, evaluation hooks, observability, and retries.  Building from scratch >>> During my freelancing/AI transition, I engineered several AI platforms including MedAI, MASX AI, and Echo AI taking them from MVP to production-style readiness. These were built using FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and included full observability setups to meet production standards.  Contributing within existing enterprise systems: At IHS Markit, I was responsible for delivering platforms within established enterprise environments. I led the migration of over 10 legacy applications to AWS microservices architecture and Angular, and built production-grade APIs and dashboards that integrated directly into enterprise data pipelines.  I’m comfortable working at both ends of the spectrum greenfield architecture and legacy modernization and I bring a structured, scalable approach to both. | What is your current location?:Essen, Germany | Are you open to a B2B collaboration contract?*:Yes | Have you been responsible for defining PostgreSQL architecture (not just using it)?:Yes I’ve not only worked with PostgreSQL in production but have also been responsible for defining its architecture in several systems, not just consuming an existing setup.  For logical database design, I’ve architected Postgres-backed persistence layers for AI pipelines including run logs, workflow states, audit trails, and domain entities. That involved designing schemas, access patterns, indexing strategies, and managing migrations, all tuned for ETL and agentic workloads.  In the medAI project, I built the compliance and security layer using Postgres with row-level security, PII stripping, and structured logging to meet data privacy and audit requirements.  At 12IQ, I contributed to a broader platform architecture where relational data was part of a multi-database infrastructure alongside document, graph, vector, and caching layers and worked across teams to align APIs, automation, and database architecture.  If you're referring to physical Postgres infrastructure like HA topologies, replication, PITR, and backup strategies I can define operational standards and requirements, and I’ve implemented these on managed Postgres setups. For large enterprise clusters, I typically collaborate with infrastructure or DBA teams to finalize topology and deployment strategy. | Have you worked with PostgreSQL in production at enterprise scale?:Yes I’ve worked with PostgreSQL in production quite a bit. For example, I used Postgres as the main structured store in production-ready AI systems including an ETL intelligence pipeline and a clinical AI platform. These setups included persistence, row-level security, and compliance focused logging.  On the enterprise side, I’ve spent years working on data heavy platforms, so I’m comfortable with the Postgres considerations that matter at scale like schema design, migrations, indexing and query tuning, connection pooling, monitoring, backups, and ensuring reliability in multi-service environments. | Mobile phone number:+49 17623463484 | Do you have any leadership experience? If so, where?:Yes I’ve led in multiple contexts, both formally and in hands-on roles where the focus was just getting things shipped.  At 12IQ, I owned the architecture and delivery of a deterministic AI platform setting the technical direction, defining patterns, and coordinating across multiple workstreams, from orchestration to validation and observability.  During my freelancing and AI transition, I led end-to-end delivery of several AI platforms from MVP to production-style readiness. I handled everything from technical decisions to CI/CD and reliability, often acting as the de facto tech lead.  And at IHS Markit, I led modernization efforts, including migrating over 10 legacy apps to AWS and Angular, while ensuring production-grade delivery within existing enterprise pipelines.  So I’m comfortable leading architecture, aligning across teams, and staying hands-on when it counts. | Have you worked on large-scale enterprise systems (e.g., high data volumes, millions of messages/day, or large user bases)?:Yes, I’ve worked extensively on large-scale enterprise systems handling high data volumes and complex integration needs. At IHS Markit, I developed scalable analytics platforms that served over 20 global clients across 7 continents. These systems processed large datasets and required robust data integrity, secure deployments, and continuous enhancements to support enterprise-grade performance. More recently at 12IQ Inc, I led the architecture of a production-grade Deterministic AI platform. This involved building modular components for orchestration, context management, and multi-model validation all designed to scale predictably and reliably in demanding environments. I’ve also delivered multi-agent pipelines and RAG-based systems that involved real-time data flows, structured storage, observability, and auto-recovery — all essential for handling high-throughput use cases with millions of messages and production-level reliability. | Last name:Bahamani | First name:Ateet | Are you proficient in English?:Yes | Are you located in any of these countries?:No - I'm located elsewhere"

I defined the core execution model (the deterministic spine), the module boundaries and interfaces, and the engineering standards (contracts, guardrails, CI/CD, observability). I’m hands-on in the code, but my main responsibility is making sure the whole platform fits together and stays scalable and auditable. | Which location are you applying for?:Poland | Are you located in any of these countries?:No - I'm located elsewhere | Have you worked with PostgreSQL in production at enterprise scale?:Yes, I’ve worked with PostgreSQL in production as a core database, including SQL schema design, migrations, indexing/performance basics, and (where needed) pgvector for embedding search. I’ve run it in real production systems, but I won’t overclaim [massive hyperscale Postgres] unless we align on what enterprise scale means in your context. | Have you worked on large-scale enterprise systems (e.g., high data volumes, millions of messages/day, or large user bases)?:Yes. At IHS Markit I worked in large enterprise codebases, owned migrations/deployments, and built secure, async-ready APIs on AWS for global clients. I won’t claim “millions of messages/day” unless I can show the metric, but I’ve definitely operated systems where high volume + reliability under load was the daily reality. | Email address:ab@masxai.com | Have you been responsible for defining PostgreSQL architecture (not just using it)?:Yes, I’ve defined the PostgreSQL architecture, not just written queries. That includes deciding what lives in Postgres vs other stores, designing the schema + data contracts, setting up migrations, and choosing how we handle indexes/performance, and (when needed) pgvector-based retrieval.  I’m not a dedicated DBA who tunes massive clusters all day but I do own the application-level Postgres architecture and make it production-ready. | Last name:Bahamani | Please submit a resume or LinkedIn profile:-920783188.pdf | Mobile phone number:+49 17623463484 | Are you proficient in English?:Yes | What is your current location?:Germany | Do you have any leadership experience?
