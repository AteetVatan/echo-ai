Recently, I’ve been building and prototyping agentic workflows (multi-step chains, tool orchestration, structured JSON outputs, reliability guardrails) and the platform pieces around them routing, control, and observability so agents behave predictably in real environments, not just demos.  What I’d bring to MTC:  Multi-agent workflows: collaborative agent patterns, strong prompting + validation for structured outputs  Cross-org security: RBAC-style permissioning, scoped tool access, policy checks, audit trails  PaaS core services: agent registration, message routing, management APIs, safe CI/CD delivery  Real-time systems (nice-to-have): practical patterns with Redis/Kafka/WebSockets/SSE  I’d love to share a concrete POC approach for secure cross-organizational agent interaction (RBAC + token forwarding + auditable routing) and how I’d ship the first solid platform slice quickly.
