12IQ,AI Architect at 12IQ Inc. (Early-stage startup),"Led architecture and end-to-end development of a large-scale Deterministic AI platform delivering predictable, auditable intelligence workflows (Python, C#, TypeScript). Architected a modular, execution-driven AI system with a single deterministic execution spine, coordinating orchestration, context management, knowledge processing, reasoning, and multi-model validation. Daily GenAI usage: Cursor / Windsurf + direct LLMs for design, coding, debugging, tests, documentation, and operational runbooks across Python, C#, TypeScript, SQL. Defined AI-first engineering standards: safe usage patterns, guardrails, and CI/CD checks to keep quality high at speed. Enabled engineers via reusable templates/patterns for tool/function calling and RAG style retrieval where applicable. Ran small experiments to evaluate AI workflows (quality, latency, cost), then standardized successful patterns into repeatable playbooks. Leading technical delivery, interviewing, mentoring, and guiding engineers and interns (API + DB + automation).",,Nov 2025,Jan 2026
