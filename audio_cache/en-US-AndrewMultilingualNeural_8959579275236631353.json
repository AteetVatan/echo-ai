    "text": "MASX-Hotspots uses 18 distinct LangGraph agent implementations, each with a specialized role in the flashpoint detection and analysis pipeline. Here's a breakdown of the key agents:\n\nCore Detection & Analysis Agents:\n Flashpoint LLM Agent: The primary agent that identifies and extracts potential geopolitical flashpoints from raw data.\n Flashpoint Validator Agent: Cross-checks and validates the flashpoints identified by the LLM agent for accuracy and relevance.\n Domain Classifier Agent: Classifies the nature or domain of each detected event e.g., military, diplomatic, economic, environmental.\n Query Planner Agent: Strategically plans and generates optimized search queries to gather more information on each flashpoint.\n Language Agent: Detects the language of source materials.\n Translation Agent: Translates content using the NLLB model to support analysis across 50+ languages.\n\nData Ingestion & Processing Agents:\n Google RSS Feeder Agent: Aggregates and processes real-time data from Google News RSS feeds.\n GDELT Feed Agent: Aggregates and processes structured event data from the GDELT Project.\n Feed Finalizer Agent: Merges, deduplicates, and finalizes the aggregated feed data for downstream analysis.\n\nSupport & Orchestration Agents:\nThe system also includes agents for Event Analysis, Fact Checking, Language Resolution, News Fetching, Validation, Logging/Auditing, Memory Management, and Merge Deduplication.\n\nThis multi-agent architecture operates on a fan-out/fan-in parallel processing model, allowing the system to efficiently scan, classify, and analyze global data streams 24/7 to identify emerging geopolitical risks.",
