    "text": "My cost optimization strategy is built around a dedupe-first, cluster-first, and tiered processing approach, which I've refined across projects like MASX-GeoSignal and ApplyBots. Here\u2019s how it works in practice:\n\n1. Dedupe-first processing: Before any expensive embedding or LLM calls, I deduplicate incoming data e.g., news articles, job postings. This alone cuts 20\u201330% of unnecessary processing.\n\n2. Cluster-first-then-summarize: Instead of summarizing every article individually, I cluster similar content first using local sentence-transformers on CPU cost: $0, then summarize only the cluster centroids. This reduces LLM calls by 80%.\n\n3. Translation only when needed: For multilingual pipelines, I translate only the summarized centroids\u2014not full articles\u2014saving 90% on translation costs.\n\n4. Provider-agnostic LLM abstraction: I use a unified interface like LiteLLM so models can be switched via environment variables. This lets me route tasks to the most cost-effective provider\u2014e.g., Together AI at $0.06/1M tokens for Llama 3.2 3B instead of GPT-4o.\n\n5. Tiered feature pipelines: Users pay only for the processing they need. Basic features use local models; advanced features trigger cloud LLMs selectively.\n\nThe result? For MASX-GeoSignal processing 10K+ URLs/day, this approach costs about $6.60/month, compared to $300/month with a naive per-article GPT-4o pipeline\u2014a 30\u201350x cost reduction without sacrificing output quality.",
