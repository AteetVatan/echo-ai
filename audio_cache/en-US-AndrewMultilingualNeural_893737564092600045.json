    "text": "At 12IQ, I co-founded the company and led the architecture and end-to-end development of our large-scale Deterministic AI platform. I architected a modular, execution-driven system with a single deterministic execution spine, coordinating orchestration, context management, knowledge processing, reasoning, and multi-model validation to deliver predictable, auditable intelligence workflows. As the hands-on Python lead, I defined core abstractions, data contracts, and CI/CD standards for production-grade reliability and scalability. I also led technical delivery, mentored engineers and interns, and successfully shipped the MVP.",
