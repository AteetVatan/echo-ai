    "text": "My vision for MASX AI in 2024-2025 is to architect a modular, dynamic multi-agent system for strategic simulation. I'm focused on integrating live geopolitical data ingestion pipelines and real-time adaptive doctrine engines. A key part of this is developing ethical simulation layers for value-aligned decision making and engineering scalable memory retrieval systems using custom vector databases with Supabase optimization. Ultimately, I'm positioning MASX AI for real-world applications in defense, policy intelligence, and mission-critical automation.",
