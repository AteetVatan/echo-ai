    "text": "One of the most challenging projects I worked on was ApplyBots, a multi-agent AI system for automating job applications. The complexity came from orchestrating multiple specialized agents\u2014each handling tasks like resume parsing, job matching, cover letter generation, and application submission\u2014while ensuring reliability, data privacy, and seamless integration across platforms.\n\nThe main challenge was handling failure modes gracefully. Early on, we encountered issues with inconsistent website structures, CAPTCHAs, and session timeouts that would break the automation flow. Instead of patching reactively, I led a redesign to build resilience into the core architecture. We implemented:\nModular, stateful agents that could retry, log errors, and fall back to manual steps when needed.\nA centralized orchestration layer to monitor agent health, manage dependencies, and ensure idempotency.\nComprehensive logging and alerting to catch failures early and reduce mean time to recovery.\n\nWe also faced tight deadlines ahead of a demo for stakeholders. When a critical third-party API we depended on became unstable days before launch, I stubbed the service locally, simulated expected responses, and worked parallelly with the provider to restore stability\u2014allowing us to demo on time without compromising functionality.\n\nThe key takeaway: anticipate failure points early, design for observability and recovery, and keep the system modular enough to adapt under pressure. That approach not only saved the timeline but also made the system more robust in production.",
