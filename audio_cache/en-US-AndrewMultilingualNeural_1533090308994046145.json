    "text": "My formal education is a Bachelor of Technology from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, which I completed between 2001 and 2005. That program gave me a strong foundation in full-stack development, covering languages like C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as database management with SQL, PL/SQL, and RDBMS principles. It also introduced me to OOP, Agile practices, and core computer science concepts like data structures, algorithms, and network protocols.\n\nBeyond my degree, I maintain a continuous learning mindset, especially in the fast-moving AI field. I've completed professional courses on platforms like LinkedIn Learning, including the \"Career Essentials in Generative AI\" certificate from Microsoft, to stay current with the latest tools and methodologies.",
