MASX-HOTSPOTS \u2013 An autonomous flashpoint detection and multilingual feed generation system powered by 18 LangGraph agents. It continuously scans and processes real-time geopolitical data to identify emerging global flashpoints and generate language-aware, entity-driven news feeds.\n\n2. MASX-GeoSignal \u2013 A high-throughput news ingestion and NLP enrichment engine capable of processing over 10,000 URLs per day. It handles raw news collection, entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and data structuring for downstream analysis.\n\n3. MASX-Forecasting \u2013 A doctrine-grounded strategic analysis module that uses 23 specialized agents to simulate geopolitical reasoning, evaluate strategic options, and produce forecasts based on established military and diplomatic doctrines.\n\nTogether, these components form an end-to-end pipeline\u2014from raw news ingestion and flashpoint detection to enriched analysis and strategic forecasting\u2014designed for real-world applications in defense, policy intelligence, and mission-critical automation.",
