    "text": "I implement a comprehensive security and compliance framework designed for sensitive data environments, especially in regulated fields like healthcare. Here\u2019s how I approach it:\n\nData Protection & Privacy\nPII Stripping: Automatically remove personally identifiable information phone numbers, addresses, dates, German medical text patterns before any LLM calls.\nSigned URLs: All file access like audio records uses time-limited signed URLs with default 1-hour expiry.\nRow-Level Security RLS: Multi-tenant data isolation enforced at the database level, ensuring users only access data within their organization.\nEncryption: Sensitive configuration and data are encrypted at rest and in transit.\n\nAccess Control & Authentication\nAPI Key Authentication: Secure, rotating API keys for external service integration.\nJWT Tokens: Stateless authentication with short-lived tokens.\nOAuth Implementation: For third-party identity providers.\nbcrypt Password Hashing: Secure storage of user credentials.\nRole-Based Permissions: Granular access control tied to user roles.\nSession-Based WebSocket Connections: Secure real-time communication.\n\nCompliance & Audit\nCompliance Audit Logging: Every data access and modification is logged with user, action, resource, and timestamp.\nRegular Reviews: Compliance requirements are mapped to controls and verified through scheduled reviews.\nCORS Middleware: Enforces secure cross-origin requests.\nRate Limiting: Protects against abuse and DDoS attacks.\n\nNon-Negotiable Rules\n1. No CAPTCHA Bypass \u2013 Automation aborts and flags for manual intervention.\n2. No ToS Violations \u2013 Only safe, compliant platforms like Greenhouse, Lever.\n3. Truth-Lock Enforcement \u2013 All AI-generated content is verified against source data.\n4. Audit Everything \u2013 Complete logs and screenshots for every automation step.\n5. No Hardcoded Secrets \u2013 All credentials managed via environment variables.\n\nStorage & Infrastructure\nSupabase Postgres with RLS for database-level security.\nSupabase S3 with signed URLs for secure file storage.\nHealth Checks with database connectivity verification.\n\nMy approach is built on minimal data collection, strict access control, and proactive monitoring\u2014ensuring safety, integrity, and user trust are never compromised.",
