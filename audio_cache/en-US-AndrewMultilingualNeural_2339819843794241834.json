    "text": "The biggest career risk I took was leaving my stable, 12-year role as a Senior Software Engineer at IHS Markit in late 2024 to become a full-time Freelance AI Engineer Consultant.\n\nFor over a decade, I had built a solid career in traditional software engineering, focusing on cloud migrations, CI/CD, and automotive analytics platforms. The move meant stepping away from a predictable salary, established routines, and a well-defined corporate path to bet entirely on my ability to build a new, specialized practice in AI and LLM integration from the ground up.\n\nIt was a calculated risk, driven by a clear vision: the future is agentic. I wanted to build enterprise-grade AI systems, not just use APIs. This leap allowed me to architect projects like MASX AI\u2014a doctrine-driven geopolitical forecasting system\u2014and develop deep expertise in LangChain, AutoGen, and RAG pipelines, which ultimately led to my role as an AI Architect.\n\nThe risk was significant, but it was the necessary pivot to transition from a software engineer to an AI engineer and strategic thinker.",
