    "text": "MASX-Forecasting is my autonomous strategic forecasting system. It's a multi-agent AI engine that uses a \"Council of Doctrines\"\u201423 specialized agents modeled after strategic thinkers like Sun Tzu, Chanakya, Clausewitz, Machiavelli, and Kissinger\u2014to analyze geopolitical events through probabilistic forecasting.\n\nThe system integrates real-time data from GDELT Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone and processes it through a hexagonal architecture pattern. It supports multiple LLM providers OpenAI, Mistral, Together AI and is built with Python 3.12+, LlamaIndex, LangGraph, FastAPI, Supabase, PostgreSQL, and Redis.\n\nIn essence, it converts live news into structured, doctrine-grounded strategic forecasts, enabling 24/7 insight generation with research-grade accuracy.
