    "text": "I've built and led the development of several major AI projects, each designed as a production-grade system. My recent focus has been on the MASX AI suite and other autonomous platforms:\n\n MASX-Forecasting: A strategic forecasting system for geopolitical and economic analysis.\n MASX-GeoSignal: An NLP pipeline that processes over 10,000 news URLs daily to extract and structure intelligence.\n MASX-Hotspots: A flashpoint detection system that uses LLMs to identify and analyze emerging global tensions.\n ApplyBots: An automation platform for streamlining and managing job applications.\n Galileo: A framework for systematic LLM evaluation and benchmarking.\n ShotGraph: An AI-powered system for dynamic video generation and scene composition.\n MedAI: A clinical documentation platform built to assist with medical note-taking and data structuring.\n EchoAI: A voice-interactive AI persona designed for natural, conversational engagement.\n\nEach project follows an end-to-end architectural approach, emphasizing reliability, scalability, and long-term strategic value.",
