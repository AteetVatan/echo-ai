    "text": "Truth-Lock Technology is the core integrity mechanism in ApplyBots that ensures every piece of AI-generated content is 100% truthful and traceable to verified source data from your CV and profile.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works in practice:\n\n1. Source-Locked Data Retrieval \n When generating a cover letter or tailoring a CV, the system uses RAG Retrieval-Augmented Generation to pull only verified facts from your uploaded documents stored in ChromaDB\u2014like your actual work history, skills, education, and achievements.\n\n2. Constraint-Based Generation \n The LLM is instructed to reference only the retrieved facts. It cannot invent new companies, skills, or experiences. For example, if your resume doesn\u2019t mention \u201cproject management,\u201d the system won\u2019t claim you have it.\n\n3. Cross-Verification & Traceability \n Every claim in the generated output is mapped back to a source document. The Truth-Lock Agent validates:\nExperience years match your resume timeline\nCompany names appear in your work history\nSkills listed are present in your skills section\nEducation details are verbatim from your CV\nJob description references include actual phrases from the job ad\n\n4. Pre-Submission Validation \n Before any application is submitted, the system runs a final check. If a discrepancy or hallucination is detected, it\u2019s flagged for your review. This ensures you never send fabricated information.\n\nIn short, Truth-Lock acts as a fact-checking layer that ties AI outputs directly to your real-world data\u2014making ApplyBots both powerful and trustworthy.",
